## Expected Learning Outcomes:  
* Use Unix Commands effectively to navigate and manage folders/files
* Use Vim Editor to create edit and save files


## Introduction to Unix:

Unix is a powerful and widely-used operating system known for its stability, flexibility, and versatility. It was developed in the 1960s and 1970s by a group of AT&T Bell Labs researchers, including Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie. Unix has become the foundation for various operating systems, including Linux and macOS, and is used in a wide range of applications, from servers and mainframes to personal computers.

One of the key features that make Unix stand out is its command-line interface, which allows users to interact with the system using textual commands. Unix commands offer a fast and efficient way to perform various tasks, ranging from basic file and folder operations to complex system administration tasks.

In this lab, we will explore some fundamental Unix commands to navigate the file system, create and manage files and directories, and manipulate file content. Familiarizing yourself with these commands will provide a solid foundation for working with Unix-based systems, enhance your command-line proficiency, and unlock the full potential of Unix's capabilities.


### Basic Unix Commands

Explore the [Unix commands and examples](https://www.cmu.edu/computing/services/comm-collab/collaboration/afs/how-to/unix-commands.pdf) for more details.

### Activity 1

Attempt the below activity using the Terminal.

1. Open the Terminal using the Applications Menu or the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl + Alt + T).
2. Navigate to the Desktop. 
3. Create a working directory with you IT number.
4. Inside the directory create 3 Folders “Activity 1” and “Activity 2” and “Activity 1.1”
5. Copy the Activity 1.1 Folder inside the Activity 1 Folder and remove Activity 1.1 from the working directory.

## Introduction to VIM Editor

Vim is a highly customizable and powerful text editor with a steep learning curve, but it becomes extremely efficient once you become familiar with its commands and capabilities. Feel free to practice these commands in Vim to enhance your productivity in text editing tasks.
In the Vim editor, you can switch between the two primary modes, Normal mode and Insert mode, to execute commands and edit the file, respectively. Here's how you can do it:
1.	Switching to Insert Mode:
   a. To enter Insert mode from Normal mode, press one of the following keys:
  	   * ```i:``` Start Insert mode before the cursor.
      * ```a:``` Start Insert mode after the cursor.
      * ```A:``` Start Insert mode at the end of the current line.
      * ```o:``` Insert a new line below the current line and start Insert mode.
      * ```O:``` Insert a new line above the current line and start Insert mode.
3.	Switching to Normal Mode:
  b. To return to Normal mode from Insert mode, press Esc key. This is the most common way to exit Insert mode.

While in Normal mode, you can execute various commands like saving the file, quitting the editor, deleting lines, copying lines, searching, and more. In Insert mode, you can freely edit the text as you would in a typical text editor.

The ability to switch between these two modes is one of the distinctive features of Vim, and it allows for efficient and precise text editing using a combination of commands and regular text input. Practice using these modes to become proficient with Vim's editing capabilities.

### Activity 2


1. Use the Vim Editor to create a file named lab_notes.txt under the Activity 2 Folder. Edit the text file by adding the different commands you have used for Question 1-5 in activity 1. Save and Quit the File.

2.	Submission

Compile a small report including screenshots showing you work. Rename the report with your IT number and covert it to a pdf file.(Example ITxxxxxxxx.pdf). Upload the pdf file to the github classroom link provided.
